\chapter{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device}

A virtio device is discovered and identified by a bus-specific method
(see the bus specific sections: \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus}~\nameref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus},
\ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO}~\nameref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO} and \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Channel I/O}~\nameref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Channel I/O}).  Each
device consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Device status field
\item Feature bits
\item Notifications
\item Device Configuration space
\item One or more virtqueues
\end{itemize}

\section{\field{Device Status} Field}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field}
During device initialization by a driver,
the driver follows the sequence of steps specified in
\ref{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device
Initialization}.

The \field{device status} field provides a simple low-level
indication of the completed steps of this sequence.
It's most useful to imagine it hooked up to traffic
lights on the console indicating the status of each device.  The
following bits are defined (listed below in the order in which
they would be typically set):
\begin{description}
\item[ACKNOWLEDGE (1)] Indicates that the guest OS has found the
  device and recognized it as a valid virtio device.

\item[DRIVER (2)] Indicates that the guest OS knows how to drive the
  device.
  \begin{note}
    There could be a significant (or infinite) delay before setting
    this bit.  For example, under Linux, drivers can be loadable modules.
  \end{note}

\item[FAILED (128)] Indicates that something went wrong in the guest,
  and it has given up on the device. This could be an internal
  error, or the driver didn't like the device for some reason, or
  even a fatal error during device operation.

\item[FEATURES_OK (8)] Indicates that the driver has acknowledged all the
  features it understands, and feature negotiation is complete.

\item[DRIVER_OK (4)] Indicates that the driver is set up and ready to
  drive the device.

\item[DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET (64)] Indicates that the device has experienced
  an error from which it can't recover.
\end{description}

The \field{device status} field starts out as 0, and is reinitialized to 0 by
the device during reset.

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Device Status Field}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field}
The driver MUST update \field{device status},
setting bits to indicate the completed steps of the driver
initialization sequence specified in
\ref{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device
Initialization}.
The driver MUST NOT clear a
\field{device status} bit.  If the driver sets the FAILED bit,
the driver MUST later reset the device before attempting to re-initialize.

The driver SHOULD NOT rely on completion of operations of a
device if DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET is set.
\begin{note}
For example, the driver can't assume requests in flight will be
completed if DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET is set, nor can it assume that
they have not been completed.  A good implementation will try to
recover by issuing a reset.
\end{note}

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Device Status Field}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field}

The device MUST NOT consume buffers or send any used buffer
notifications to the driver before DRIVER_OK.

\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field / DEVICENEEDSRESET}The device SHOULD set DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET when it enters an error state
that a reset is needed.  If DRIVER_OK is set, after it sets DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET, the device
MUST send a device configuration change notification to the driver.

\section{Feature Bits}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Feature Bits}

Each virtio device offers all the features it understands.  During
device initialization, the driver reads this and tells the device the
subset that it accepts.  The only way to renegotiate is to reset
the device.

This allows for forwards and backwards compatibility: if the device is
enhanced with a new feature bit, older drivers will not write that
feature bit back to the device.  Similarly, if a driver is enhanced with a feature
that the device doesn't support, it see the new feature is not offered.

Feature bits are allocated as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[0 to 23, and 50 to 127] Feature bits for the specific device type

\item[24 to 40] Feature bits reserved for extensions to the queue and
  feature negotiation mechanisms

\item[41 to 49, and 128 and above] Feature bits reserved for future extensions.
\end{description}

\begin{note}
For example, feature bit 0 for a network device (i.e.
Device ID 1) indicates that the device supports checksumming of
packets.
\end{note}

In particular, new fields in the device configuration space are
indicated by offering a new feature bit.

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Feature Bits}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Feature Bits}
The driver MUST NOT accept a feature which the device did not offer,
and MUST NOT accept a feature which requires another feature which was
not accepted.

The driver SHOULD go into backwards compatibility mode
if the device does not offer a feature it understands, otherwise MUST
set the FAILED \field{device status} bit and cease initialization.

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Feature Bits}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Feature Bits}
The device MUST NOT offer a feature which requires another feature
which was not offered.  The device SHOULD accept any valid subset
of features the driver accepts, otherwise it MUST fail to set the
FEATURES_OK \field{device status} bit when the driver writes it.

If a device has successfully negotiated a set of features
at least once (by accepting the FEATURES_OK \field{device
status} bit during device initialization), then it SHOULD
NOT fail re-negotiation of the same set of features after
a device or system reset.  Failure to do so would interfere
with resuming from suspend and error recovery.

\subsection{Legacy Interface: A Note on Feature
Bits}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Feature
Bits / Legacy Interface: A Note on Feature Bits}

Transitional Drivers MUST detect Legacy Devices by detecting that
the feature bit VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 is not offered.
Transitional devices MUST detect Legacy drivers by detecting that
VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 has not been acknowledged by the driver.

In this case device is used through the legacy interface.

Legacy interface support is OPTIONAL.
Thus, both transitional and non-transitional devices and
drivers are compliant with this specification.

Requirements pertaining to transitional devices and drivers
is contained in sections named 'Legacy Interface' like this one.

When device is used through the legacy interface, transitional
devices and transitional drivers MUST operate according to the
requirements documented within these legacy interface sections.
Specification text within these sections generally does not apply
to non-transitional devices.

\section{Notifications}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device
/ Notifications}

The notion of sending a notification (driver to device or device
to driver) plays an important role in this specification. The
modus operandi of the notifications is transport specific.

There are three types of notifications: 
\begin{itemize}
\item configuration change notification
\item available buffer notification
\item used buffer notification. 
\end{itemize}

Configuration change notifications and used buffer notifications are sent
by the device, the recipient is the driver. A configuration change
notification indicates that the device configuration space has changed; a
used buffer notification indicates that a buffer may have been made used
on the virtqueue designated by the notification.

Available buffer notifications are sent by the driver, the recipient is
the device. This type of notification indicates that a buffer may have
been made available on the virtqueue designated by the notification.

The semantics, the transport-specific implementations, and other
important aspects of the different notifications are specified in detail
in the following chapters.

Most transports implement notifications sent by the device to the
driver using interrupts. Therefore, in previous versions of this
specification, these notifications were often called interrupts.
Some names defined in this specification still retain this interrupt
terminology. Occasionally, the term event is used to refer to
a notification or a receipt of a notification.

\section{Device Reset}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Reset}

The driver may want to initiate a device reset at various times; notably,
it is required to do so during device initialization and device cleanup.

The mechanism used by the driver to initiate the reset is transport specific.

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Device Reset}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Reset}

A device MUST reinitialize \field{device status} to 0 after receiving a reset.

A device MUST NOT send notifications or interact with the queues after
indicating completion of the reset by reinitializing \field{device status}
to 0, until the driver re-initializes the device.

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Device Reset}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Reset}

The driver SHOULD consider a driver-initiated reset complete when it
reads \field{device status} as 0.

\section{Device Configuration Space}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space}

Device configuration space is generally used for rarely-changing or
initialization-time parameters.  Where configuration fields are
optional, their existence is indicated by feature bits: Future
versions of this specification will likely extend the device
configuration space by adding extra fields at the tail.

\begin{note}
The device configuration space uses the little-endian format
for multi-byte fields.
\end{note}

Each transport also provides a generation count for the device configuration
space, which will change whenever there is a possibility that two
accesses to the device configuration space can see different versions of that
space.

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Device Configuration Space}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space}
Drivers MUST NOT assume reads from
fields greater than 32 bits wide are atomic, nor are reads from
multiple fields: drivers SHOULD read device configuration space fields like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
u32 before, after;
do {
        before = get_config_generation(device);
        // read config entry/entries.
        after = get_config_generation(device);
} while (after != before);
\end{lstlisting}

For optional configuration space fields, the driver MUST check that the
corresponding feature is offered before accessing that part of the configuration
space.
\begin{note}
See section \ref{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization} for details on feature negotiation.
\end{note}

Drivers MUST
NOT limit structure size and device configuration space size.  Instead,
drivers SHOULD only check that device configuration space is {\em large enough} to
contain the fields necessary for device operation.

\begin{note}
For example, if the specification states that device configuration
space 'includes a single 8-bit field' drivers should understand this to mean that
the device configuration space might also include an arbitrary amount of
tail padding, and accept any device configuration space size equal to or
greater than the specified 8-bit size.
\end{note}

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Device Configuration Space}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space}
The device MUST allow reading of any device-specific configuration
field before FEATURES_OK is set by the driver.  This includes fields which are
conditional on feature bits, as long as those feature bits are offered
by the device.

\subsection{Legacy Interface: A Note on Device Configuration Space endian-ness}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space / Legacy Interface: A Note on Configuration Space endian-ness}

Note that for legacy interfaces, device configuration space is generally the
guest's native endian, rather than PCI's little-endian.
The correct endian-ness is documented for each device.

\subsection{Legacy Interface: Device Configuration Space}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space / Legacy Interface: Device Configuration Space}

Legacy devices did not have a configuration generation field, thus are
susceptible to race conditions if configuration is updated.  This
affects the block \field{capacity} (see \ref{sec:Device Types /
Block Device / Device configuration layout}) and
network \field{mac} (see \ref{sec:Device Types / Network Device /
Device configuration layout}) fields;
when using the legacy interface, drivers SHOULD
read these fields multiple times until two reads generate a consistent
result.

\section{Virtqueues}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}

The mechanism for bulk data transport on virtio devices is
pretentiously called a virtqueue. Each device can have zero or more
virtqueues\footnote{For example, the simplest network device has one virtqueue for
transmit and one for receive.}.

Driver makes requests available to device by adding
an available buffer to the queue, i.e., adding a buffer
describing the request to a virtqueue, and optionally triggering
a driver event, i.e., sending an available buffer notification
to the device.

Device executes the requests and - when complete - adds
a used buffer to the queue, i.e., lets the driver
know by marking the buffer as used. Device can then trigger
a device event, i.e., send a used buffer notification to the driver.

Device reports the number of bytes it has written to memory for
each buffer it uses. This is referred to as ``used length''.

Device is not generally required to use buffers in
the same order in which they have been made available
by the driver.

Some devices always use descriptors in the same order in which
they have been made available. These devices can offer the
VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER feature. If negotiated, this knowledge
might allow optimizations or simplify driver and/or device code.

Each virtqueue can consist of up to 3 parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Descriptor Area - used for describing buffers
\item Driver Area - extra data supplied by driver to the device
\item Device Area - extra data supplied by device to driver
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
Note that previous versions of this spec used different names for
these parts (following \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Split Virtqueues}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Descriptor Table - for the Descriptor Area
\item Available Ring - for the Driver Area
\item Used Ring - for the Device Area
\end{itemize}

\end{note}

Two formats are supported: Split Virtqueues (see \ref{sec:Basic
Facilities of a Virtio Device / Split
Virtqueues}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device /
Split Virtqueues}) and Packed Virtqueues (see \ref{sec:Basic
Facilities of a Virtio Device / Packed
Virtqueues}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device /
Packed Virtqueues}).

Every driver and device supports either the Packed or the Split
Virtqueue format, or both.

\subsection{Virtqueue Reset}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}

When VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET is negotiated, the driver can reset a virtqueue
individually. The way to reset the virtqueue is transport specific.

Virtqueue reset is divided into two parts. The driver first resets a queue and
can afterwards optionally re-enable it.

\subsubsection{Virtqueue Reset}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Reset}

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Virtqueue Reset}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Reset}

After a queue has been reset by the driver, the device MUST NOT execute
any requests from that virtqueue, or notify the driver for it.

The device MUST reset any state of a virtqueue to the default state,
including the available state and the used state.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Virtqueue Reset}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Reset}

After the driver tells the device to reset a queue, the driver MUST verify that
the queue has actually been reset.

After the queue has been successfully reset, the driver MAY release any
resource associated with that virtqueue.

\subsubsection{Virtqueue Re-enable}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Re-enable}

This process is the same as the initialization process of a single queue during
the initialization of the entire device.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Virtqueue Re-enable}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Re-enable}

The device MUST observe any queue configuration that may have been
changed by the driver, like the maximum queue size.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Virtqueue Re-enable}{Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset / Virtqueue Re-enable}

When re-enabling a queue, the driver MUST configure the queue resources
as during initial virtqueue discovery, but optionally with different
parameters.

\input{split-ring.tex}

\input{packed-ring.tex}

\section{Driver Notifications} \label{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}
The driver is sometimes required to send an available buffer
notification to the device.

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has not been negotiated,
this notification involves sending the
virtqueue number to the device (method depending on the transport).

However, some devices benefit from the ability to find out the
amount of available data in the queue without accessing the virtqueue in memory:
for efficiency or as a debugging aid.

To help with these optimizations, when VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA
has been negotiated, driver notifications to the device include
the following information:

\begin{description}
\item [vqn] VQ number to be notified.
\item [next_off] Offset
      within the ring where the next available ring entry
      will be written.
      When VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED has not been negotiated this refers to the
      15 least significant bits of the available index.
      When VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED has been negotiated this refers to the offset
      (in units of descriptor entries)
      within the descriptor ring where the next available
      descriptor will be written.
\item [next_wrap] Wrap Counter.
      With VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED this is the wrap counter
      referring to the next available descriptor.
      Without VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED this is the most significant bit
      (bit 15) of the available index.
\end{description}

Note that the driver can send multiple notifications even without
making any more buffers available. When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA
has been negotiated, these notifications would then have
identical \field{next_off} and \field{next_wrap} values.

\input{shared-mem.tex}

\section{Exporting Objects}\label{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Exporting Objects}

When an object created by one virtio device needs to be
shared with a seperate virtio device, the first device can
export the object by generating a UUID which can then
be passed to the second device to identify the object.

What constitutes an object, how to export objects, and
how to import objects are defined by the individual device
types. It is RECOMMENDED that devices generate version 4
UUIDs as specified by \hyperref[intro:rfc4122]{[RFC4122]}.

\chapter{General Initialization And Device Operation}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation}

We start with an overview of device initialization, then expand on the
details of the device and how each step is preformed.  This section
is best read along with the bus-specific section which describes
how to communicate with the specific device.

\section{Device Initialization}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Device Initialization}{General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}
The driver MUST follow this sequence to initialize a device:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reset the device.

\item Set the ACKNOWLEDGE status bit: the guest OS has noticed the device.

\item Set the DRIVER status bit: the guest OS knows how to drive the device.

\item\label{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation /
Device Initialization / Read feature bits} Read device feature bits, and write the subset of feature bits
   understood by the OS and driver to the device.  During this step the
   driver MAY read (but MUST NOT write) the device-specific configuration fields to check that it can support the device before accepting it.

\item\label{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Set FEATURES-OK} Set the FEATURES_OK status bit.  The driver MUST NOT accept
   new feature bits after this step.

\item\label{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Re-read FEATURES-OK} Re-read \field{device status} to ensure the FEATURES_OK bit is still
   set: otherwise, the device does not support our subset of features
   and the device is unusable.

\item\label{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Device-specific Setup} Perform device-specific setup, including discovery of virtqueues for the
   device, optional per-bus setup, reading and possibly writing the
   device's virtio configuration space, and population of virtqueues.

\item\label{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Set DRIVER-OK} Set the DRIVER_OK status bit.  At this point the device is
   ``live''.
\end{enumerate}

If any of these steps go irrecoverably wrong, the driver SHOULD
set the FAILED status bit to indicate that it has given up on the
device (it can reset the device later to restart if desired).  The
driver MUST NOT continue initialization in that case.

The driver MUST NOT send any buffer available notifications to
the device before setting DRIVER_OK.

\subsection{Legacy Interface: Device Initialization}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Legacy Interface: Device Initialization}
Legacy devices did not support the FEATURES_OK status bit, and thus did
not have a graceful way for the device to indicate unsupported feature
combinations.  They also did not provide a clear mechanism to end
feature negotiation, which meant that devices finalized features on
first-use, and no features could be introduced which radically changed
the initial operation of the device.

Legacy driver implementations often used the device before setting the
DRIVER_OK bit, and sometimes even before writing the feature bits
to the device.

The result was the steps \ref{itm:General Initialization And
Device Operation / Device Initialization / Set FEATURES-OK} and
\ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device
Initialization / Re-read FEATURES-OK} were omitted, and steps
\ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation /
Device Initialization / Read feature bits},
\ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Device-specific Setup} and \ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Set DRIVER-OK}
were conflated.

Therefore, when using the legacy interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The transitional driver MUST execute the initialization
sequence as described in \ref{sec:General Initialization And Device
Operation / Device Initialization}
but omitting the steps \ref{itm:General Initialization And Device
Operation / Device Initialization / Set FEATURES-OK} and
\ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device
Initialization / Re-read FEATURES-OK}.

\item
The transitional device MUST support the driver
writing device configuration fields
before the step \ref{itm:General Initialization And Device Operation /
Device Initialization / Read feature bits}.
\item
The transitional device MUST support the driver
using the device before the step \ref{itm:General Initialization
And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Set DRIVER-OK}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Device Operation}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Operation}

When operating the device, each field in the device configuration
space can be changed by either the driver or the device.

Whenever such a configuration change is triggered by the device,
driver is notified. This makes it possible for drivers to
cache device configuration, avoiding expensive configuration
reads unless notified.


\subsection{Notification of Device Configuration Changes}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Operation / Notification of Device Configuration Changes}

For devices where the device-specific configuration information can be
changed, a configuration change notification is sent when a
device-specific configuration change occurs.

In addition, this notification is triggered by the device setting
DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET (see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field / DEVICENEEDSRESET}).

\section{Device Cleanup}\label{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Cleanup}

Once the driver has set the DRIVER_OK status bit, all the configured
virtqueue of the device are considered live.  None of the virtqueues
of a device are live once the device has been reset.

\drivernormative{\subsection}{Device Cleanup}{General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Cleanup}

A driver MUST NOT alter virtqueue entries for exposed buffers,
i.e., buffers which have been
made available to the device (and not been used by the device)
of a live virtqueue.

Thus a driver MUST ensure a virtqueue isn't live (by device reset) before removing exposed buffers.

\chapter{Virtio Transport Options}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options}

Virtio can use various different buses, thus the standard is split
into virtio general and bus-specific sections.

\section{Virtio Over PCI Bus}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus}

Virtio devices are commonly implemented as PCI devices.

A Virtio device can be implemented as any kind of PCI device:
a Conventional PCI device or a PCI Express
device.  To assure designs meet the latest level
requirements, see 
the PCI-SIG home page at \url{http://www.pcisig.com} for any
approved changes.

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Virtio Over PCI Bus}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus}
A Virtio device using Virtio Over PCI Bus MUST expose to
guest an interface that meets the specification requirements of
the appropriate PCI specification: \hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}
and \hyperref[intro:PCIe]{[PCIe]}
respectively. 

\subsection{PCI Device Discovery}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery}

Any PCI device with PCI Vendor ID 0x1AF4, and PCI Device ID 0x1000 through
0x107F inclusive is a virtio device. The actual value within this range
indicates which virtio device is supported by the device.
The PCI Device ID is calculated by adding 0x1040 to the Virtio Device ID,
as indicated in section \ref{sec:Device Types}.
Additionally, devices MAY utilize a Transitional PCI Device ID range,
0x1000 to 0x103F depending on the device type.

\devicenormative{\subsubsection}{PCI Device Discovery}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery}

Devices MUST have the PCI Vendor ID 0x1AF4.
Devices MUST either have the PCI Device ID calculated by adding 0x1040
to the Virtio Device ID, as indicated in section \ref{sec:Device
Types} or have the Transitional PCI Device ID depending on the device type,
as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Transitional PCI Device ID  &  Virtio Device    \\
\hline \hline
0x1000      &   network card     \\
\hline
0x1001     &   block device     \\
\hline
0x1002     & memory ballooning (traditional)  \\
\hline
0x1003     &      console       \\
\hline
0x1004     &     SCSI host      \\
\hline
0x1005     &  entropy source    \\
\hline
0x1009     &   9P transport     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For example, the network card device with the Virtio Device ID 1
has the PCI Device ID 0x1041 or the Transitional PCI Device ID 0x1000.

The PCI Subsystem Vendor ID and the PCI Subsystem Device ID MAY reflect
the PCI Vendor and Device ID of the environment (for informational purposes by the driver).

Non-transitional devices SHOULD have a PCI Device ID in the range
0x1040 to 0x107f.
Non-transitional devices SHOULD have a PCI Revision ID of 1 or higher.
Non-transitional devices SHOULD have a PCI Subsystem Device ID of 0x40 or higher.

This is to reduce the chance of a legacy driver attempting
to drive the device.

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{PCI Device Discovery}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery}
Drivers MUST match devices with the PCI Vendor ID 0x1AF4 and
the PCI Device ID in the range 0x1040 to 0x107f,
calculated by adding 0x1040 to the Virtio Device ID,
as indicated in section \ref{sec:Device Types}.
Drivers for device types listed in section \ref{sec:Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery}
MUST match devices with the PCI Vendor ID 0x1AF4 and
the Transitional PCI Device ID indicated in section
 \ref{sec:Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery}.

Drivers MUST match any PCI Revision ID value.
Drivers MAY match any PCI Subsystem Vendor ID and any
PCI Subsystem Device ID value.

\subsubsection{Legacy Interfaces: A Note on PCI Device Discovery}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Discovery / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on PCI Device Discovery}
Transitional devices MUST have a PCI Revision ID of 0.
Transitional devices MUST have the PCI Subsystem Device ID
matching the Virtio Device ID, as indicated in section \ref{sec:Device Types}.
Transitional devices MUST have the Transitional PCI Device ID in
the range 0x1000 to 0x103f.

This is to match legacy drivers.

\subsection{PCI Device Layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout}

The device is configured via I/O and/or memory regions (though see
\ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / PCI configuration access capability}
for access via the PCI configuration space), as specified by Virtio
Structure PCI Capabilities.

Fields of different sizes are present in the device
configuration regions.
All 64-bit, 32-bit and 16-bit fields are little-endian.
64-bit fields are to be treated as two 32-bit fields,
with low 32 bit part followed by the high 32 bit part.

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{PCI Device Layout}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout}

For device configuration access, the driver MUST use 8-bit wide
accesses for 8-bit wide fields, 16-bit wide and aligned accesses
for 16-bit wide fields and 32-bit wide and aligned accesses for
32-bit and 64-bit wide fields. For 64-bit fields, the driver MAY
access each of the high and low 32-bit parts of the field
independently.

\devicenormative{\subsubsection}{PCI Device Layout}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout}

For 64-bit device configuration fields, the device MUST allow driver
independent access to high and low 32-bit parts of the field.

\subsection{Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}

The virtio device configuration layout includes several structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Common configuration
\item Notifications
\item ISR Status
\item Device-specific configuration (optional)
\item PCI configuration access
\end{itemize}

Each structure can be mapped by a Base Address register (BAR) belonging to
the function, or accessed via the special VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG field in the PCI configuration space.

The location of each structure is specified using a vendor-specific PCI capability located
on the capability list in PCI configuration space of the device.
This virtio structure capability uses little-endian format; all fields are
read-only for the driver unless stated otherwise:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_cap {
        u8 cap_vndr;    /* Generic PCI field: PCI_CAP_ID_VNDR */
        u8 cap_next;    /* Generic PCI field: next ptr. */
        u8 cap_len;     /* Generic PCI field: capability length */
        u8 cfg_type;    /* Identifies the structure. */
        u8 bar;         /* Where to find it. */
        u8 id;          /* Multiple capabilities of the same type */
        u8 padding[2];  /* Pad to full dword. */
        le32 offset;    /* Offset within bar. */
        le32 length;    /* Length of the structure, in bytes. */
};
\end{lstlisting}

This structure can be followed by extra data, depending on
\field{cfg_type}, as documented below.

The fields are interpreted as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[\field{cap_vndr}]
        0x09; Identifies a vendor-specific capability.

\item[\field{cap_next}]
        Link to next capability in the capability list in the PCI configuration space.

\item[\field{cap_len}]
        Length of this capability structure, including the whole of
        struct virtio_pci_cap, and extra data if any.
        This length MAY include padding, or fields unused by the driver.

\item[\field{cfg_type}]
        identifies the structure, according to the following table:

\begin{lstlisting}
/* Common configuration */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_COMMON_CFG        1
/* Notifications */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_NOTIFY_CFG        2
/* ISR Status */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_ISR_CFG           3
/* Device specific configuration */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_DEVICE_CFG        4
/* PCI configuration access */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG           5
/* Shared memory region */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_SHARED_MEMORY_CFG 8
/* Vendor-specific data */
#define VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_VENDOR_CFG        9
\end{lstlisting}

        Any other value is reserved for future use.

        Each structure is detailed individually below.

        The device MAY offer more than one structure of any type - this makes it
        possible for the device to expose multiple interfaces to drivers.  The order of
        the capabilities in the capability list specifies the order of preference
        suggested by the device.  A device may specify that this ordering mechanism be
        overridden by the use of the \field{id} field.
        \begin{note}
          For example, on some hypervisors, notifications using IO accesses are
        faster than memory accesses. In this case, the device would expose two
        capabilities with \field{cfg_type} set to VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_NOTIFY_CFG:
        the first one addressing an I/O BAR, the second one addressing a memory BAR.
        In this example, the driver would use the I/O BAR if I/O resources are available, and fall back on
        memory BAR when I/O resources are unavailable.
        \end{note}

\item[\field{bar}]
        values 0x0 to 0x5 specify a Base Address register (BAR) belonging to
        the function located beginning at 10h in PCI Configuration Space
        and used to map the structure into Memory or I/O Space.
        The BAR is permitted to be either 32-bit or 64-bit, it can map Memory Space
        or I/O Space.

        Any other value is reserved for future use.

\item[\field{id}]
        Used by some device types to uniquely identify multiple capabilities
        of a certain type. If the device type does not specify the meaning of
        this field, its contents are undefined.


\item[\field{offset}]
        indicates where the structure begins relative to the base address associated
        with the BAR.  The alignment requirements of \field{offset} are indicated
        in each structure-specific section below.

\item[\field{length}]
        indicates the length of the structure.

        \field{length} MAY include padding, or fields unused by the driver, or
        future extensions.

        \begin{note}
        For example, a future device might present a large structure size of several
        MBytes.
        As current devices never utilize structures larger than 4KBytes in size,
        driver MAY limit the mapped structure size to e.g.
        4KBytes (thus ignoring parts of structure after the first
        4KBytes) to allow forward compatibility with such devices without loss of
        functionality and without wasting resources.
        \end{note}
\end{description}

A variant of this type, struct virtio_pci_cap64, is defined for
those capabilities that require offsets or lengths larger than
4GiB:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_cap64 {
        struct virtio_pci_cap cap;
        u32 offset_hi;
        u32 length_hi;
};
\end{lstlisting}

Given that the \field{cap.length} and \field{cap.offset} fields
are only 32 bit, the additional \field{offset_hi} and \field{length_hi}
fields provide the most significant 32 bits of a total 64 bit offset and
length within the BAR specified by \field{cap.bar}.

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}

The driver MUST ignore any vendor-specific capability structure which has
a reserved \field{cfg_type} value.

The driver SHOULD use the first instance of each virtio structure type they can
support.

The driver MUST accept a \field{cap_len} value which is larger than specified here.

The driver MUST ignore any vendor-specific capability structure which has
a reserved \field{bar} value.

        The drivers SHOULD only map part of configuration structure
        large enough for device operation.  The drivers MUST handle
        an unexpectedly large \field{length}, but MAY check that \field{length}
        is large enough for device operation.

The driver MUST NOT write into any field of the capability structure,
with the exception of those with \field{cap_type} VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG as
detailed in \ref{drivernormative:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / PCI configuration access capability}.

\devicenormative{\subsubsection}{Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}

The device MUST include any extra data (from the beginning of the \field{cap_vndr} field
through end of the extra data fields if any) in \field{cap_len}.
The device MAY append extra data
or padding to any structure beyond that.

If the device presents multiple structures of the same type, it SHOULD order
them from optimal (first) to least-optimal (last).

\subsubsection{Common configuration structure layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Common configuration structure layout}

The common configuration structure is found at the \field{bar} and \field{offset} within the VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_COMMON_CFG capability; its layout is below.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_common_cfg {
        /* About the whole device. */
        le32 device_feature_select;     /* read-write */
        le32 device_feature;            /* read-only for driver */
        le32 driver_feature_select;     /* read-write */
        le32 driver_feature;            /* read-write */

        le16 num_queues;                /* read-only for driver */
        u8 device_status;               /* read-write */
        u8 config_generation;           /* read-only for driver */

        /* About a specific virtqueue. */
        le16 queue_select;              /* read-write */
        le16 queue_size;                /* read-write */
        le16 queue_msix_vector;         /* read-write */
        le16 queue_enable;              /* read-write */
        le16 queue_notify_off;          /* read-only for driver */
        le64 queue_desc;                /* read-write */
        le64 queue_driver;              /* read-write */
        le64 queue_device;              /* read-write */
        le16 queue_notify_data;         /* read-only for driver */
        le16 queue_reset;               /* read-write */
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
\item[\field{device_feature_select}]
        The driver uses this to select which feature bits \field{device_feature} shows.
        Value 0x0 selects Feature Bits 0 to 31, 0x1 selects Feature Bits 32 to 63, etc.

\item[\field{device_feature}]
        The device uses this to report which feature bits it is
        offering to the driver: the driver writes to
        \field{device_feature_select} to select which feature bits are presented.

\item[\field{driver_feature_select}]
        The driver uses this to select which feature bits \field{driver_feature} shows.
        Value 0x0 selects Feature Bits 0 to 31, 0x1 selects Feature Bits 32 to 63, etc.

\item[\field{driver_feature}]
        The driver writes this to accept feature bits offered by the device.
        Driver Feature Bits selected by \field{driver_feature_select}.

\item[\field{config_msix_vector}]
        The driver sets the Configuration Vector for MSI-X.

\item[\field{num_queues}]
        The device specifies the maximum number of virtqueues supported here.

\item[\field{device_status}]
        The driver writes the device status here (see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Status Field}). Writing 0 into this
        field resets the device.

\item[\field{config_generation}]
        Configuration atomicity value.  The device changes this every time the
        configuration noticeably changes.

\item[\field{queue_select}]
        Queue Select. The driver selects which virtqueue the following
        fields refer to.

\item[\field{queue_size}]
        Queue Size.  On reset, specifies the maximum queue size supported by
        the device. This can be modified by the driver to reduce memory requirements.
        A 0 means the queue is unavailable.

\item[\field{queue_msix_vector}]
        The driver uses this to specify the queue vector for MSI-X.

\item[\field{queue_enable}]
        The driver uses this to selectively prevent the device from executing requests from this virtqueue.
        1 - enabled; 0 - disabled.

\item[\field{queue_notify_off}]
        The driver reads this to calculate the offset from start of Notification structure at
        which this virtqueue is located.
        \begin{note} this is \em{not} an offset in bytes.
        See \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Notification capability} below.
        \end{note}

\item[\field{queue_desc}]
        The driver writes the physical address of Descriptor Area here.  See section \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}.

\item[\field{queue_driver}]
        The driver writes the physical address of Driver Area here.  See section \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}.

\item[\field{queue_device}]
        The driver writes the physical address of Device Area here.  See section \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}.

\item[\field{queue_notify_data}]
        This field exists only if VIRTIO_F_NOTIF_CONFIG_DATA has been negotiated.
        The driver will use this value to put it in the 'virtqueue number' field
        in the available buffer notification structure.
        See section \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Available Buffer Notifications}.
        \begin{note}
        This field provides the device with flexibility to determine how virtqueues
        will be referred to in available buffer notifications.
        In a trivial case the device can set \field{queue_notify_data}=vqn. Some devices
        may benefit from providing another value, for example an internal virtqueue
        identifier, or an internal offset related to the virtqueue number.
        \end{note}

\item[\field{queue_reset}]
        The driver uses this to selectively reset the queue.
        This field exists only if VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been
        negotiated. (see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}).

\end{description}

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Common configuration structure layout}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Common configuration structure layout}
\field{offset} MUST be 4-byte aligned.

The device MUST present at least one common configuration capability.

The device MUST present the feature bits it is offering in \field{device_feature}, starting at bit \field{device_feature_select} $*$ 32 for any \field{device_feature_select} written by the driver.
\begin{note}
  This means that it will present 0 for any \field{device_feature_select} other than 0 or 1, since no feature defined here exceeds 63.
\end{note}

The device MUST present any valid feature bits the driver has written in \field{driver_feature}, starting at bit \field{driver_feature_select} $*$ 32 for any \field{driver_feature_select} written by the driver.  Valid feature bits are those which are subset of the corresponding \field{device_feature} bits.  The device MAY present invalid bits written by the driver.

\begin{note}
  This means that a device can ignore writes for feature bits it never
  offers, and simply present 0 on reads.  Or it can just mirror what the driver wrote
  (but it will still have to check them when the driver sets FEATURES_OK).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  A driver shouldn't write invalid bits anyway, as per \ref{drivernormative:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}, but this attempts to handle it.
\end{note}

The device MUST present a changed \field{config_generation} after the
driver has read a device-specific configuration value which has
changed since any part of the device-specific configuration was last
read.
\begin{note}
As \field{config_generation} is an 8-bit value, simply incrementing it
on every configuration change could violate this requirement due to wrap.
Better would be to set an internal flag when it has changed,
and if that flag is set when the driver reads from the device-specific
configuration, increment \field{config_generation} and clear the flag.
\end{note}

The device MUST reset when 0 is written to \field{device_status}, and
present a 0 in \field{device_status} once that is done.

The device MUST present a 0 in \field{queue_enable} on reset.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been negotiated, the device MUST present a 0 in
\field{queue_reset} on reset.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been negotiated, the device MUST present a 0 in
\field{queue_reset} after the virtqueue is enabled with \field{queue_enable}.

The device MUST reset the queue when 1 is written to \field{queue_reset}. The
device MUST continue to present 1 in \field{queue_reset} as long as the queue reset
is ongoing. The device MUST present 0 in both \field{queue_reset} and \field{queue_enable}
when queue reset has completed.
(see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}).

The device MUST present a 0 in \field{queue_size} if the virtqueue
corresponding to the current \field{queue_select} is unavailable.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED has not been negotiated, the device MUST
present either a value of 0 or a power of 2 in
\field{queue_size}.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Common configuration structure layout}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Common configuration structure layout}

The driver MUST NOT write to \field{device_feature}, \field{num_queues}, \field{config_generation}, \field{queue_notify_off} or \field{queue_notify_data}.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED has been negotiated,
the driver MUST NOT write the value 0 to \field{queue_size}.
If VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED has not been negotiated,
the driver MUST NOT write a value which is not a power of 2 to \field{queue_size}.

The driver MUST configure the other virtqueue fields before enabling the virtqueue
with \field{queue_enable}.

After writing 0 to \field{device_status}, the driver MUST wait for a read of
\field{device_status} to return 0 before reinitializing the device.

The driver MUST NOT write a 0 to \field{queue_enable}.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been negotiated, after the driver writes 1 to
\field{queue_reset} to reset the queue, the driver MUST NOT consider queue
reset to be complete until it reads back 0 in \field{queue_reset}. The driver
MAY re-enable the queue by writing 1 to \field{queue_enable} after ensuring
that other virtqueue fields have been set up correctly. The driver MAY set
driver-writeable queue configuration values to different values than those that
were used before the queue reset.
(see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}).

\subsubsection{Notification structure layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Notification capability}

The notification location is found using the VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_NOTIFY_CFG
capability.  This capability is immediately followed by an additional
field, like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_notify_cap {
        struct virtio_pci_cap cap;
        le32 notify_off_multiplier; /* Multiplier for queue_notify_off. */
};
\end{lstlisting}

\field{notify_off_multiplier} is combined with the \field{queue_notify_off} to
derive the Queue Notify address within a BAR for a virtqueue:

\begin{lstlisting}
        cap.offset + queue_notify_off * notify_off_multiplier
\end{lstlisting}

The \field{cap.offset} and \field{notify_off_multiplier} are taken from the
notification capability structure above, and the \field{queue_notify_off} is
taken from the common configuration structure.

\begin{note}
For example, if \field{notifier_off_multiplier} is 0, the device uses
the same Queue Notify address for all queues.
\end{note}

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Notification capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Notification capability}
The device MUST present at least one notification capability.

For devices not offering VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA:

The \field{cap.offset} MUST be 2-byte aligned.

The device MUST either present \field{notify_off_multiplier} as an even power of 2,
or present \field{notify_off_multiplier} as 0.

The value \field{cap.length} presented by the device MUST be at least 2
and MUST be large enough to support queue notification offsets
for all supported queues in all possible configurations.

For all queues, the value \field{cap.length} presented by the device MUST satisfy:
\begin{lstlisting}
cap.length >= queue_notify_off * notify_off_multiplier + 2
\end{lstlisting}

For devices offering VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA:

The device MUST either present \field{notify_off_multiplier} as a
number that is a power of 2 that is also a multiple 4,
or present \field{notify_off_multiplier} as 0.

The \field{cap.offset} MUST be 4-byte aligned.

The value \field{cap.length} presented by the device MUST be at least 4
and MUST be large enough to support queue notification offsets
for all supported queues in all possible configurations.

For all queues, the value \field{cap.length} presented by the device MUST satisfy:
\begin{lstlisting}
cap.length >= queue_notify_off * notify_off_multiplier + 4
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{ISR status capability}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / ISR status capability}

The VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_ISR_CFG capability
refers to at least a single byte, which contains the 8-bit ISR status field
to be used for INT\#x interrupt handling.

The \field{offset} for the \field{ISR status} has no alignment requirements.

The ISR bits allow the driver to distinguish between device-specific configuration
change interrupts and normal virtqueue interrupts:

\begin{tabular}{ |l||l|l|l| }
\hline
Bits       & 0                               & 1               &  2 to 31 \\
\hline
Purpose    & Queue Interrupt  & Device Configuration Interrupt & Reserved \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To avoid an extra access, simply reading this register resets it to 0 and
causes the device to de-assert the interrupt.

In this way, driver read of ISR status causes the device to de-assert
an interrupt.

See sections \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Used Buffer Notifications} and \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notification of Device Configuration Changes} for how this is used.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{ISR status capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / ISR status capability}

The device MUST present at least one VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_ISR_CFG capability.  

The device MUST set the Device Configuration Interrupt bit
in \field{ISR status} before sending a device configuration
change notification to the driver.

If MSI-X capability is disabled, the device MUST set the Queue
Interrupt bit in \field{ISR status} before sending a virtqueue
notification to the driver.

If MSI-X capability is disabled, the device MUST set the Interrupt Status
bit in the PCI Status register in the PCI Configuration Header of
the device to the logical OR of all bits in \field{ISR status} of
the device.  The device then asserts/deasserts INT\#x interrupts unless masked
according to standard PCI rules \hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}.

The device MUST reset \field{ISR status} to 0 on driver read.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{ISR status capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / ISR status capability}

If MSI-X capability is enabled, the driver SHOULD NOT access
\field{ISR status} upon detecting a Queue Interrupt.

\subsubsection{Device-specific configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Device-specific configuration}

The device MUST present at least one VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_DEVICE_CFG capability for
any device type which has a device-specific configuration.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Device-specific configuration}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Device-specific configuration}

The \field{offset} for the device-specific configuration MUST be 4-byte aligned.

\subsubsection{Shared memory capability}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Shared memory capability}

Shared memory regions \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio
Device / Shared Memory Regions} are enumerated on the PCI transport
as a sequence of VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_SHARED_MEMORY_CFG capabilities, one per region.

The capability is defined by a struct virtio_pci_cap64 and
utilises the \field{cap.id} to allow multiple shared memory
regions per device.
The identifier in \field{cap.id} does not denote a certain order of
preference; it is only used to uniquely identify a region.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Shared memory capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Shared memory capability}

The region defined by the combination of the \field{cap.offset},
\field{offset_hi}, and \field{cap.length}, \field{length_hi}
fields MUST be contained within the BAR specified by
\field{cap.bar}.

The \field{cap.id} MUST be unique for any one device instance.

\subsubsection{Vendor data capability}\label{sec:Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout /
Vendor data capability}

The optional Vendor data capability allows the device to present
vendor-specific data to the driver, without
conflicts, for debugging and/or reporting purposes,
and without conflicting with standard functionality.

This capability augments but does not replace the standard
subsystem ID and subsystem vendor ID fields
(offsets 0x2C and 0x2E in the PCI configuration space header)
as specified by \hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}.

Vendor data capability is enumerated on the PCI transport
as a VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_VENDOR_CFG capability.

The capability has the following structure:
\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_vndr_data {
        u8 cap_vndr;    /* Generic PCI field: PCI_CAP_ID_VNDR */
        u8 cap_next;    /* Generic PCI field: next ptr. */
        u8 cap_len;     /* Generic PCI field: capability length */
        u8 cfg_type;    /* Identifies the structure. */
        u16 vendor_id;  /* Identifies the vendor-specific format. */
	/* For Vendor Definition */
	/* Pads structure to a multiple of 4 bytes */
	/* Reads must not have side effects */
};
\end{lstlisting}

Where \field{vendor_id} identifies the PCI-SIG assigned Vendor ID
as specified by \hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}.

Note that the capability size is required to be a multiple of 4.

To make it safe for a generic driver to access the capability,
reads from this capability MUST NOT have any side effects.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Vendor data capability}{Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout /
Vendor data capability}

Devices CAN present \field{vendor_id} that does not match
either the PCI Vendor ID or the PCI Subsystem Vendor ID.

Devices CAN present multiple Vendor data capabilities with
either different or identical \field{vendor_id} values.

The value \field{vendor_id} MUST NOT equal 0x1AF4.

The size of the Vendor data capability MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes.

Reads of the Vendor data capability by the driver MUST NOT have any
side effects.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Vendor data capability}{Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout /
Vendor data capability}

The driver SHOULD NOT use the Vendor data capability except
for debugging and reporting purposes.

The driver MUST qualify the \field{vendor_id} before
interpreting or writing into the Vendor data capability.

\subsubsection{PCI configuration access capability}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / PCI configuration access capability}

The VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG capability
creates an alternative (and likely suboptimal) access method to the
common configuration, notification, ISR and device-specific configuration regions.

The capability is immediately followed by an additional field like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_pci_cfg_cap {
        struct virtio_pci_cap cap;
        u8 pci_cfg_data[4]; /* Data for BAR access. */
};
\end{lstlisting}

The fields \field{cap.bar}, \field{cap.length}, \field{cap.offset} and
\field{pci_cfg_data} are read-write (RW) for the driver.

To access a device region, the driver writes into the capability
structure (ie. within the PCI configuration space) as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The driver sets the BAR to access by writing to \field{cap.bar}.

\item The driver sets the size of the access by writing 1, 2 or 4 to
  \field{cap.length}.

\item The driver sets the offset within the BAR by writing to
  \field{cap.offset}.
\end{itemize}

At that point, \field{pci_cfg_data} will provide a window of size
\field{cap.length} into the given \field{cap.bar} at offset \field{cap.offset}.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{PCI configuration access capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / PCI configuration access capability}

The device MUST present at least one VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG capability.

Upon detecting driver write access
to \field{pci_cfg_data}, the device MUST execute a write access
at offset \field{cap.offset} at BAR selected by \field{cap.bar} using the first \field{cap.length}
bytes from \field{pci_cfg_data}.

Upon detecting driver read access
to \field{pci_cfg_data}, the device MUST
execute a read access of length cap.length at offset \field{cap.offset}
at BAR selected by \field{cap.bar} and store the first \field{cap.length} bytes in
\field{pci_cfg_data}.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{PCI configuration access capability}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / PCI configuration access capability}

The driver MUST NOT write a \field{cap.offset} which is not
a multiple of \field{cap.length} (ie. all accesses MUST be aligned).

The driver MUST NOT read or write \field{pci_cfg_data}
unless \field{cap.bar}, \field{cap.length} and \field{cap.offset}
address \field{cap.length} bytes within a BAR range
specified by some other Virtio Structure PCI Capability
of type other than \field{VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG}.

\subsubsection{Legacy Interfaces: A Note on PCI Device Layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on PCI Device Layout}

Transitional devices MUST present part of configuration
registers in a legacy configuration structure in BAR0 in the first I/O
region of the PCI device, as documented below.
When using the legacy interface, transitional drivers
MUST use the legacy configuration structure in BAR0 in the first
I/O region of the PCI device, as documented below.

When using the legacy interface the driver MAY access
the device-specific configuration region using any width accesses, and
a transitional device MUST present driver with the same results as
when accessed using the ``natural'' access method (i.e.
32-bit accesses for 32-bit fields, etc).

Note that this is possible because while the virtio common configuration structure is PCI
(i.e. little) endian, when using the legacy interface the device-specific
configuration region is encoded in the native endian of the guest (where such distinction is
applicable).

When used through the legacy interface, the virtio common configuration structure looks as follows:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ |X||X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X| }
\hline
 Bits & 32 & 32 & 32 & 16 & 16 & 16 & 8 & 8 \\
\hline
 Read / Write & R & R+W & R+W & R & R+W & R+W & R+W & R \\
\hline
 Purpose & Device Features bits 0:31 & Driver Features bits 0:31 &
  Queue Address & \field{queue_size} & \field{queue_select} & Queue Notify &
  Device Status & ISR \newline Status \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

If MSI-X is enabled for the device, two additional fields
immediately follow this header:

\begin{tabular}{ |l||l|l| }
\hline
Bits       & 16             & 16     \\
\hline
Read/Write & R+W            & R+W    \\
\hline
Purpose (MSI-X) & \field{config_msix_vector}  & \field{queue_msix_vector} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: When MSI-X capability is enabled, device-specific configuration starts at
byte offset 24 in virtio common configuration structure structure. When MSI-X capability is not
enabled, device-specific configuration starts at byte offset 20 in virtio
header.  ie. once you enable MSI-X on the device, the other fields move.
If you turn it off again, they move back!

Any device-specific configuration space immediately follows
these general headers:

\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|}
\hline
Bits & Device Specific & \multirow{3}{*}{\ldots} \\
\cline{1-2}
Read / Write & Device Specific & \\
\cline{1-2}
Purpose & Device Specific & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

When accessing the device-specific configuration space
using the legacy interface, transitional
drivers MUST access the device-specific configuration space
at an offset immediately following the general headers.

When using the legacy interface, transitional
devices MUST present the device-specific configuration space
if any at an offset immediately following the general headers.

Note that only Feature Bits 0 to 31 are accessible through the
Legacy Interface. When used through the Legacy Interface,
Transitional Devices MUST assume that Feature Bits 32 to 63
are not acknowledged by Driver.

As legacy devices had no \field{config_generation} field,
see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device
Configuration Space / Legacy Interface: Device Configuration
Space}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Device Configuration Space / Legacy Interface: Device Configuration Space} for workarounds.

\subsubsection{Non-transitional Device With Legacy Driver: A Note
on PCI Device Layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio
Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Non-transitional Device With
Legacy Driver: A Note on PCI Device Layout}

All known legacy drivers check either the PCI Revision or the
Device and Vendor IDs, and thus won't attempt to drive a
non-transitional device.

A buggy legacy driver might mistakenly attempt to drive a
non-transitional device. If support for such drivers is required
(as opposed to fixing the bug), the following would be the
recommended way to detect and handle them.
\begin{note}
Such buggy drivers are not currently known to be used in
production.
\end{note}

\subparagraph{Device Requirements: Non-transitional Device With Legacy Driver}
\label{drivernormative:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI
Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation /
Device Initialization / Non-transitional Device With Legacy
Driver}
\label{devicenormative:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI
Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation /
Device Initialization / Non-transitional Device With Legacy
Driver}

Non-transitional devices, on a platform where a legacy driver for
a legacy device with the same ID (including PCI Revision, Device
and Vendor IDs) is known to have previously existed,
SHOULD take the following steps to cause the legacy driver to
fail gracefully when it attempts to drive them:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Present an I/O BAR in BAR0, and
\item Respond to a single-byte zero write to offset 18
   (corresponding to Device Status register in the legacy layout)
   of BAR0 by presenting zeroes on every BAR and ignoring writes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation}

\subsubsection{Device Initialization}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}

This documents PCI-specific steps executed during Device Initialization.

\paragraph{Virtio Device Configuration Layout Detection}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Virtio Device Configuration Layout Detection}

As a prerequisite to device initialization, the driver scans the
PCI capability list, detecting virtio configuration layout using Virtio
Structure PCI capabilities as detailed in \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / Virtio Structure PCI Capabilities}

\subparagraph{Legacy Interface: A Note on Device Layout Detection}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Virtio Device Configuration Layout Detection / Legacy Interface: A Note on Device Layout Detection}

Legacy drivers skipped the Device Layout Detection step, assuming legacy
device configuration space in BAR0 in I/O space unconditionally.

Legacy devices did not have the Virtio PCI Capability in their
capability list.

Therefore:

Transitional devices MUST expose the Legacy Interface in I/O
space in BAR0.

Transitional drivers MUST look for the Virtio PCI
Capabilities on the capability list.
If these are not present, driver MUST assume a legacy device,
and use it through the legacy interface.

Non-transitional drivers MUST look for the Virtio PCI
Capabilities on the capability list.
If these are not present, driver MUST assume a legacy device,
and fail gracefully.

\paragraph{MSI-X Vector Configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / MSI-X Vector Configuration}

When MSI-X capability is present and enabled in the device
(through standard PCI configuration space) \field{config_msix_vector} and \field{queue_msix_vector} are used to map configuration change and queue
interrupts to MSI-X vectors. In this case, the ISR Status is unused.

Writing a valid MSI-X Table entry number, 0 to 0x7FF, to
\field{config_msix_vector}/\field{queue_msix_vector} maps interrupts triggered
by the configuration change/selected queue events respectively to
the corresponding MSI-X vector. To disable interrupts for an
event type, the driver unmaps this event by writing a special NO_VECTOR
value:

\begin{lstlisting}
/* Vector value used to disable MSI for queue */
#define VIRTIO_MSI_NO_VECTOR            0xffff
\end{lstlisting}

Note that mapping an event to vector might require device to
allocate internal device resources, and thus could fail. 

\devicenormative{\subparagraph}{MSI-X Vector Configuration}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / MSI-X Vector Configuration}

A device that has an MSI-X capability SHOULD support at least 2
and at most 0x800 MSI-X vectors.
Device MUST report the number of vectors supported in
\field{Table Size} in the MSI-X Capability as specified in
\hyperref[intro:PCI]{[PCI]}.
The device SHOULD restrict the reported MSI-X Table Size field
to a value that might benefit system performance.
\begin{note}
For example, a device which does not expect to send
interrupts at a high rate might only specify 2 MSI-X vectors.
\end{note}
Device MUST support mapping any event type to any valid
vector 0 to MSI-X \field{Table Size}.
Device MUST support unmapping any event type.

The device MUST return vector mapped to a given event,
(NO_VECTOR if unmapped) on read of \field{config_msix_vector}/\field{queue_msix_vector}.
The device MUST have all queue and configuration change
events are unmapped upon reset.

Devices SHOULD NOT cause mapping an event to vector to fail
unless it is impossible for the device to satisfy the mapping
request.  Devices MUST report mapping
failures by returning the NO_VECTOR value when the relevant
\field{config_msix_vector}/\field{queue_msix_vector} field is read. 

\drivernormative{\subparagraph}{MSI-X Vector Configuration}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / MSI-X Vector Configuration}

Driver MUST support device with any MSI-X Table Size 0 to 0x7FF.
Driver MAY fall back on using INT\#x interrupts for a device
which only supports one MSI-X vector (MSI-X Table Size = 0).

Driver MAY intepret the Table Size as a hint from the device
for the suggested number of MSI-X vectors to use.

Driver MUST NOT attempt to map an event to a vector
outside the MSI-X Table supported by the device,
as reported by \field{Table Size} in the MSI-X Capability.

After mapping an event to vector, the
driver MUST verify success by reading the Vector field value: on
success, the previously written value is returned, and on
failure, NO_VECTOR is returned. If a mapping failure is detected,
the driver MAY retry mapping with fewer vectors, disable MSI-X
or report device failure.

\paragraph{Virtqueue Configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Virtqueue Configuration}

As a device can have zero or more virtqueues for bulk data
transport\footnote{For example, the simplest network device has two virtqueues.}, the driver
needs to configure them as part of the device-specific
configuration.

The driver typically does this as follows, for each virtqueue a device has:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the virtqueue index (first queue is 0) to \field{queue_select}.

\item Read the virtqueue size from \field{queue_size}. This controls how big the virtqueue is
  (see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues}). If this field is 0, the virtqueue does not exist.

\item Optionally, select a smaller virtqueue size and write it to \field{queue_size}.

\item Allocate and zero Descriptor Table, Available and Used rings for the
   virtqueue in contiguous physical memory.

\item Optionally, if MSI-X capability is present and enabled on the
  device, select a vector to use to request interrupts triggered
  by virtqueue events. Write the MSI-X Table entry number
  corresponding to this vector into \field{queue_msix_vector}. Read
  \field{queue_msix_vector}: on success, previously written value is
  returned; on failure, NO_VECTOR value is returned.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Legacy Interface: A Note on Virtqueue Configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization / Virtqueue Configuration / Legacy Interface: A Note on Virtqueue Configuration}
When using the legacy interface, the queue layout follows \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Layout}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Layout} with an alignment of 4096.
Driver writes the physical address, divided
by 4096 to the Queue Address field\footnote{The 4096 is based on the x86 page size, but it's also large
enough to ensure that the separate parts of the virtqueue are on
separate cache lines.
}.  There was no mechanism to negotiate the queue size.

\subsubsection{Available Buffer Notifications}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Available Buffer Notifications}

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has not been negotiated,
the driver sends an available buffer notification to the device by writing
the 16-bit virtqueue index
of this virtqueue to the Queue Notify address.

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has been negotiated,
the driver sends an available buffer notification to the device by writing
the following 32-bit value to the Queue Notify address:
\lstinputlisting{notifications-le.c}

See \ref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}~\nameref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}
for the definition of the components.

See \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI Device Layout / Notification capability}
for how to calculate the Queue Notify address.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Available Buffer Notifications}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Available Buffer Notifications}
If VIRTIO_F_NOTIF_CONFIG_DATA has been negotiated:
\begin{itemize}
\item If VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has not been negotiated, the driver MUST use the
\field{queue_notify_data} value instead of the virtqueue index.
\item If VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has been negotiated, the driver MUST set the
\field{vqn} field to the \field{queue_notify_data} value.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Used Buffer Notifications}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Used Buffer Notifications}

If a used buffer notification is necessary for a virtqueue, the device would typically act as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If MSI-X capability is disabled:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the lower bit of the ISR Status field for the device.

    \item Send the appropriate PCI interrupt for the device.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item If MSI-X capability is enabled:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If \field{queue_msix_vector} is not NO_VECTOR,
      request the appropriate MSI-X interrupt message for the
      device, \field{queue_msix_vector} sets the MSI-X Table entry
      number.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Used Buffer Notifications}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Used Buffer Notifications}

If MSI-X capability is enabled and \field{queue_msix_vector} is
NO_VECTOR for a virtqueue, the device MUST NOT deliver an interrupt
for that virtqueue.

\subsubsection{Notification of Device Configuration Changes}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notification of Device Configuration Changes}

Some virtio PCI devices can change the device configuration
state, as reflected in the device-specific configuration region of the device. In this case:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If MSI-X capability is disabled:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the second lower bit of the ISR Status field for the device.

    \item Send the appropriate PCI interrupt for the device.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item If MSI-X capability is enabled:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If \field{config_msix_vector} is not NO_VECTOR,
      request the appropriate MSI-X interrupt message for the
      device, \field{config_msix_vector} sets the MSI-X Table entry
      number.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

A single interrupt MAY indicate both that one or more virtqueue has
been used and that the configuration space has changed.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Notification of Device Configuration Changes}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notification of Device Configuration Changes}

If MSI-X capability is enabled and \field{config_msix_vector} is
NO_VECTOR, the device MUST NOT deliver an interrupt
for device configuration space changes.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Notification of Device Configuration Changes}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notification of Device Configuration Changes}

A driver MUST handle the case where the same interrupt is used to indicate
both device configuration space change and one or more virtqueues being used.

\subsubsection{Driver Handling Interrupts}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Driver Handling Interrupts}
The driver interrupt handler would typically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If MSI-X capability is disabled:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Read the ISR Status field, which will reset it to zero.
      \item If the lower bit is set:
        look through all virtqueues for the
        device, to see if any progress has been made by the device
        which requires servicing.
      \item If the second lower bit is set:
        re-examine the configuration space to see what changed.
    \end{itemize}
  \item If MSI-X capability is enabled:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Look through all virtqueues mapped to that MSI-X vector for the
        device, to see if any progress has been made by the device
        which requires servicing.
      \item
        If the MSI-X vector is equal to \field{config_msix_vector},
        re-examine the configuration space to see what changed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Virtio Over MMIO}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO}

Virtual environments without PCI support (a common situation in
embedded devices models) might use simple memory mapped device
(``virtio-mmio'') instead of the PCI device.

The memory mapped virtio device behaviour is based on the PCI
device specification. Therefore most operations including device
initialization, queues configuration and buffer transfers are
nearly identical. Existing differences are described in the
following sections.

\subsection{MMIO Device Discovery}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Discovery}

Unlike PCI, MMIO provides no generic device discovery mechanism.  For each
device, the guest OS will need to know the location of the registers
and interrupt(s) used.  The suggested binding for systems using
flattened device trees is shown in this example:

\begin{lstlisting}
// EXAMPLE: virtio_block device taking 512 bytes at 0x1e000, interrupt 42.
virtio_block@1e000 {
        compatible = "virtio,mmio";
        reg = <0x1e000 0x200>;
        interrupts = <42>;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{MMIO Device Register Layout}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Register Layout}

MMIO virtio devices provide a set of memory mapped control
registers followed by a device-specific configuration space,
described in the table~\ref{tab:Virtio Trasport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Register Layout}.

All register values are organized as Little Endian.

\newcommand{\mmioreg}[5]{% Name Function Offset Direction Description

The device MUST present each event by setting the corresponding bit in \field{InterruptStatus} from the
moment it takes place, until the driver acknowledges the interrupt
by writing a corresponding bit mask to the \field{InterruptACK} register.  Bits which
do not represent events which took place MUST be zero.

Upon reset, the device MUST clear all bits in \field{InterruptStatus} and ready bits in the

The device MUST change value returned in \field{ConfigGeneration} if there is any risk of a
driver seeing an inconsistent configuration state.

The device MUST NOT access virtual queue contents when \field{QueueReady} is zero (0x0).

If VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been negotiated, the device MUST present a 0 in

(see \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}).

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{MMIO Device Register Layout}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Register Layout}
The driver MUST NOT access memory locations not described in the
table \ref{tab:Virtio Trasport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Register Layout}
(or, in case of the configuration space, described in the device specification),
MUST NOT write to the read-only registers (direction R) and
MUST NOT read from the write-only registers (direction W).

The driver MUST only use 32 bit wide and aligned reads and writes to access the control registers
described in table \ref{tab:Virtio Trasport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO Device Register Layout}.
For the device-specific configuration space, the driver MUST use 8 bit wide accesses for
8 bit wide fields, 16 bit wide and aligned accesses for 16 bit wide fields and 32 bit wide and
aligned accesses for 32 and 64 bit wide fields.

The driver MUST ignore a device with \field{MagicValue} which is not 0x74726976,
although it MAY report an error.

The driver MUST ignore a device with \field{Version} which is not 0x2,
although it MAY report an error.

The driver MUST ignore a device with \field{DeviceID} 0x0,
but MUST NOT report any error.

Before reading from \field{DeviceFeatures}, the driver MUST write a value to \field{DeviceFeaturesSel}.

Before writing to the \field{DriverFeatures} register, the driver MUST write a value to the \field{DriverFeaturesSel} register.

The driver MUST write a value to \field{QueueNum} which is less than

When \field{QueueReady} is not zero, the driver MUST NOT access
\field{QueueNum}, \field{QueueDescLow}, \field{QueueDescHigh},
\field{QueueDriverLow}, \field{QueueDriverHigh}, \field{QueueDeviceLow}, \field{QueueDeviceHigh}.

To stop using the queue the driver MUST write zero (0x0) to this

synchronization.

The driver MUST ignore undefined bits in \field{InterruptStatus}.

The driver MUST write a value with a bit mask describing events it handled into \field{InterruptACK} when
it finishes handling an interrupt and MUST NOT set any of the undefined bits in the value.

If VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET has been negotiated, after the driver writes 1 to
\field{QueueReset} to reset the queue, the driver MUST NOT consider queue
reset to be complete until it reads back 0 in \field{QueueReset}. The driver
MAY re-enable the queue by writing 1 to \field{QueueReady} after ensuring
that other virtqueue fields have been set up correctly. The driver MAY set
driver-writeable queue configuration values to different values than those
that were used before the queue reset.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Device Initialization}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}

The driver MUST start the device initialization by reading and
checking values from \field{MagicValue} and \field{Version}.
If both values are valid, it MUST read \field{DeviceID}
and if its value is zero (0x0) MUST abort initialization and
MUST NOT access any other register.

Drivers not expecting shared memory MUST NOT use the shared
memory registers.

Further initialization MUST follow the procedure described in
\ref{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}~\nameref{sec:General Initialization And Device Operation / Device Initialization}.

\subsubsection{Virtqueue Configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Virtqueue Configuration}

The driver will typically initialize the virtual queue in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the queue writing its index (first queue is 0) to
   \field{QueueSel}.

\item Check if the queue is not already in use: read \field{QueueReady},
   and expect a returned value of zero (0x0).

\item Read maximum queue size (number of elements) from
   \field{QueueNumMax}. If the returned value is zero (0x0) the
   queue is not available.

\item Allocate and zero the queue memory, making sure the memory
   is physically contiguous.

\item Notify the device about the queue size by writing the size to
   \field{QueueNum}.

\item Write physical addresses of the queue's Descriptor Area,
   Driver Area and Device Area to (respectively) the
   \field{QueueDescLow}/\field{QueueDescHigh},
   \field{QueueDriverLow}/\field{QueueDriverHigh} and
   \field{QueueDeviceLow}/\field{QueueDeviceHigh} register pairs.

\item Write 0x1 to \field{QueueReady}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Available Buffer Notifications}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Available Buffer Notifications}

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has not been negotiated,
the driver sends an available buffer notification to the device by writing
the 16-bit virtqueue index
of the queue to be notified to \field{QueueNotify}.

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has been negotiated,
the driver sends an available buffer notification to the device by writing
the following 32-bit value to \field{QueueNotify}:
\lstinputlisting{notifications-le.c}

See \ref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}~\nameref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}
for the definition of the components.

\subsubsection{Notifications From The Device}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notifications From The Device}

The memory mapped virtio device is using a single, dedicated
interrupt signal, which is asserted when at least one of the
bits described in the description of \field{InterruptStatus}
is set. This is how the device sends a used buffer notification
or a configuration change notification to the device.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Notifications From The Device}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / MMIO-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Notifications From The Device}
After receiving an interrupt, the driver MUST read
\field{InterruptStatus} to check what caused the interrupt (see the
register description).  The used buffer notification bit being set
SHOULD be interpreted as a used buffer notification for each active
virtqueue.  After the interrupt is handled, the driver MUST acknowledge
it by writing a bit mask corresponding to the handled events to the
InterruptACK register.

\subsection{Legacy interface}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over MMIO / Legacy interface}

The legacy MMIO transport used page-based addressing, resulting
in a slightly different control register layout, the device
initialization and the virtual queue configuration procedure.

The virtual queue page size is defined by writing to \field{GuestPageSize},

virtual queues are configured.

The virtual queue layout follows

with the alignment defined in \field{QueueAlign}.

The virtual queue is configured as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the queue writing its index (first queue is 0) to
   \field{QueueSel}.

\item Check if the queue is not already in use: read \field{QueuePFN},
   expecting a returned value of zero (0x0).

\item Read maximum queue size (number of elements) from
   \field{QueueNumMax}. If the returned value is zero (0x0) the
   queue is not available.

\item Allocate and zero the queue pages in contiguous virtual
   memory, aligning the Used Ring to an optimal boundary (usually
   page size). The driver should choose a queue size smaller than or
   equal to \field{QueueNumMax}.

\item Notify the device about the queue size by writing the size to
   \field{QueueNum}.

\item Notify the device about the used alignment by writing its value
   in bytes to \field{QueueAlign}.

\item Write the physical number of the first page of the queue to
   the \field{QueuePFN} register.
\end{enumerate}

Notification mechanisms did not change.

\section{Virtio Over Channel I/O}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Channel I/O}

S/390 based virtual machines support neither PCI nor MMIO, so a
different transport is needed there.

virtio-ccw uses the standard channel I/O based mechanism used for
the majority of devices on S/390. A virtual channel device with a
special control unit type acts as proxy to the virtio device
(similar to the way virtio-pci uses a PCI device) and
configuration and operation of the virtio device is accomplished
(mostly) via channel commands. This means virtio devices are
discoverable via standard operating system algorithms, and adding
virtio support is mainly a question of supporting a new control
unit type.

As the S/390 is a big endian machine, the data structures transmitted
via channel commands are big-endian: this is made clear by use of
the types be16, be32 and be64.

\subsection{Basic Concepts}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Basic Concepts}

As a proxy device, virtio-ccw uses a channel-attached I/O control
unit with a special control unit type (0x3832) and a control unit
model corresponding to the attached virtio device's subsystem
device ID, accessed via a virtual I/O subchannel and a virtual
channel path of type 0x32. This proxy device is discoverable via
normal channel subsystem device discovery (usually a STORE
SUBCHANNEL loop) and answers to the basic channel commands:

\begin{itemize}
\item NO-OPERATION (0x03)
\item BASIC SENSE (0x04)
\item TRANSFER IN CHANNEL (0x08)
\item SENSE ID (0xe4)
\end{itemize}

For a virtio-ccw proxy device, SENSE ID will return the following
information:

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
\hline
Bytes & Description & Contents \\
\hline \hline
0     & reserved              & 0xff \\
\hline
1-2   & control unit type     & 0x3832 \\
\hline
3     & control unit model    & <virtio device id> \\
\hline
4-5   & device type           & zeroes (unset) \\
\hline
6     & device model          & zeroes (unset) \\
\hline
7-255 & extended SenseId data & zeroes (unset) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A virtio-ccw proxy device facilitates:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Discovery and attachment of virtio devices (as described above).
\item Initialization of virtqueues and transport-specific facilities (using
      virtio-specific channel commands).
\item Notifications (via hypercall and a combination of I/O interrupts
      and indicator bits).
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Channel Commands for Virtio}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio
over channel I/O / Basic Concepts/ Channel Commands for Virtio}

In addition to the basic channel commands, virtio-ccw defines a
set of channel commands related to configuration and operation of
virtio:

\begin{lstlisting}
#define CCW_CMD_SET_VQ 0x13
#define CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET 0x33
#define CCW_CMD_SET_IND 0x43
#define CCW_CMD_SET_CONF_IND 0x53
#define CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER 0x73
#define CCW_CMD_READ_FEAT 0x12
#define CCW_CMD_WRITE_FEAT 0x11
#define CCW_CMD_READ_CONF 0x22
#define CCW_CMD_WRITE_CONF 0x21
#define CCW_CMD_WRITE_STATUS 0x31
#define CCW_CMD_READ_VQ_CONF 0x32
#define CCW_CMD_SET_VIRTIO_REV 0x83
#define CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS 0x72
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Notifications}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio
over channel I/O / Basic Concepts/ Notifications}

Available buffer notifications are realized as a hypercall. No additional
setup by the driver is needed. The operation of available buffer
notifications is described in section \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options /
Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Guest->Host Notification}.

Used buffer notifications are realized either as so-called classic or
adapter I/O interrupts depending on a transport level negotiation. The
initialization is described in sections \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options
/ Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators
/ Setting Up Classic Queue Indicators} and \ref{sec:Virtio Transport
Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up
Indicators / Setting Up Two-Stage Queue Indicators} respectively.  The
operation of each flavor is described in sections \ref{sec:Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation /
Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Classic I/O Interrupts} and
\ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device
Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Adapter I/O
Interrupts} respectively. 

Configuration change notifications are done using so-called classic I/O
interrupts. The initialization is described in section \ref{sec:Virtio
Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization /
Setting Up Indicators / Setting Up Configuration Change Indicators} and
the operation in section \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over
channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification
via Classic I/O Interrupts}.

\devicenormative{\subsubsection}{Basic Concepts}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Basic Concepts}

The virtio-ccw device acts like a normal channel device, as specified
in \hyperref[intro:S390 PoP]{[S390 PoP]} and \hyperref[intro:S390 Common I/O]{[S390 Common I/O]}. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
\item A device MUST post a unit check with command reject for any command
  it does not support.

\item If a driver did not suppress length checks for a channel command,
  the device MUST present a subchannel status as detailed in the
  architecture when the actual length did not match the expected length.

\item If a driver did suppress length checks for a channel command, the
  device MUST present a check condition if the transmitted data does
  not contain enough data to process the command. If the driver submitted
  a buffer that was too long, the device SHOULD accept the command.
\end{itemize}

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{Basic Concepts}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Basic Concepts}

A driver for virtio-ccw devices MUST check for a control unit
type of 0x3832 and MUST ignore the device type and model.

A driver SHOULD attempt to provide the correct length in a channel
command even if it suppresses length checks for that command.

\subsection{Device Initialization}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization}

virtio-ccw uses several channel commands to set up a device.

\subsubsection{Setting the Virtio Revision}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting the Virtio Revision}

CCW_CMD_SET_VIRTIO_REV is issued by the driver to set the revision of
the virtio-ccw transport it intends to drive the device with. It uses the
following communication structure:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_rev_info {
        be16 revision;
        be16 length;
        u8 data[];
};
\end{lstlisting}

\field{revision} contains the desired revision id, \field{length} the length of the
data portion and \field{data} revision-dependent additional desired options.

The following values are supported:

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l| }
\hline
\field{revision} & \field{length} & \field{data}      & remarks \\
\hline \hline
0        & 0      & <empty>   & legacy interface; transitional devices only \\
\hline
1        & 0      & <empty>   & Virtio 1 \\
\hline
2        & 0      & <empty>   & CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS support \\
\hline
3-n      &        &           & reserved for later revisions \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note that a change in the virtio standard does not necessarily
correspond to a change in the virtio-ccw revision.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Setting the Virtio Revision}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting the Virtio Revision}

A device MUST post a unit check with command reject for any \field{revision}
it does not support. For any invalid combination of \field{revision}, \field{length}
and \field{data}, it MUST post a unit check with command reject as well. A
non-transitional device MUST reject revision id 0.

A device SHOULD answer with command reject to any virtio-ccw specific
channel command that is not contained in the revision selected by the
driver.

A device MUST answer with command reject to any attempt to select a different revision
after a revision has been successfully selected by the driver.

A device MUST treat the revision as unset from the time the associated
subchannel has been enabled until a revision has been successfully set
by the driver. This implies that revisions are not persistent across
disabling and enabling of the associated subchannel.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Setting the Virtio Revision}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting the Virtio Revision}

A driver SHOULD start with trying to set the highest revision it
supports and continue with lower revisions if it gets a command reject.

A driver MUST NOT issue any other virtio-ccw specific channel commands
prior to setting the revision.

After a revision has been successfully selected by the driver, it
MUST NOT attempt to select a different revision.

\paragraph{Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Setting the Virtio Revision}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting the Virtio Revision / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Setting the Virtio Revision}

A legacy device will not support the CCW_CMD_SET_VIRTIO_REV and answer
with a command reject. A non-transitional driver MUST stop trying to
operate this device in that case. A transitional driver MUST operate
the device as if it had been able to set revision 0.

A legacy driver will not issue the CCW_CMD_SET_VIRTIO_REV prior to
issuing other virtio-ccw specific channel commands. A non-transitional
device therefore MUST answer any such attempts with a command reject.
A transitional device MUST assume in this case that the driver is a
legacy driver and continue as if the driver selected revision 0. This
implies that the device MUST reject any command not valid for revision
0, including a subsequent CCW_CMD_SET_VIRTIO_REV.

\subsubsection{Configuring a Virtqueue}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Configuring a Virtqueue}

CCW_CMD_READ_VQ_CONF is issued by the driver to obtain information
about a queue. It uses the following structure for communicating:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct vq_config_block {
        be16 index;
        be16 max_num;
};
\end{lstlisting}

The requested number of buffers for queue \field{index} is returned in
\field{max_num}.

Afterwards, CCW_CMD_SET_VQ is issued by the driver to inform the
device about the location used for its queue. The transmitted
structure is

\begin{lstlisting}
struct vq_info_block {
        be64 desc;
        be32 res0;
        be16 index;
        be16 num;
        be64 driver;
        be64 device;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\field{desc}, \field{driver} and \field{device} contain the guest
addresses for the descriptor area,
available area and used area for queue \field{index}, respectively. The actual
virtqueue size (number of allocated buffers) is transmitted in \field{num}.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Configuring a Virtqueue}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Configuring a Virtqueue}

\field{res0} is reserved and MUST be ignored by the device.

\paragraph{Legacy Interface: A Note on Configuring a Virtqueue}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Configuring a Virtqueue / Legacy Interface: A Note on Configuring a Virtqueue}

For a legacy driver or for a driver that selected revision 0,
CCW_CMD_SET_VQ uses the following communication block:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct vq_info_block_legacy {
        be64 queue;
        be32 align;
        be16 index;
        be16 num;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\field{queue} contains the guest address for queue \field{index}, \field{num} the number of buffers
and \field{align} the alignment. The queue layout follows \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Layout}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Layout}.

\subsubsection{Communicating Status Information}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Communicating Status Information}

The driver changes the status of a device via the
CCW_CMD_WRITE_STATUS command, which transmits an 8 bit status
value.

As described in
\ref{devicenormative:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Feature Bits},
a device sometimes fails to set the \field{device status} field: For example, it
might fail to accept the FEATURES_OK status bit during device initialization.

With revision 2, CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS is defined: It reads an 8 bit status
value from the device and acts as a reverse operation to CCW_CMD_WRITE_STATUS.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Communicating Status Information}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Communicating Status Information}

If the device posts a unit check with command reject in response to the
CCW_CMD_WRITE_STATUS command, the driver MUST assume that the device failed
to set the status and the \field{device status} field retained
its previous value.

If at least revision 2 has been negotiated, the driver SHOULD use the
CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS command to retrieve the \field{device status} field after
a configuration change has been detected.

If not at least revision 2 has been negotiated, the driver MUST NOT attempt
to issue the CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS command.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Communicating Status Information}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Communicating Status Information}

If the device fails to set the \field{device status} field
to the value written by the driver, the device MUST assure
that the \field{device status} field is left unchanged and
MUST post a unit check with command reject.

If at least revision 2 has been negotiated, the device MUST return the
current \field{device status} field if the CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS
command is issued.

\subsubsection{Handling Device Features}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Handling Device Features}

Feature bits are arranged in an array of 32 bit values, making
for a total of 8192 feature bits. Feature bits are in
little-endian byte order.

The CCW commands dealing with features use the following
communication block:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_feature_desc {
        le32 features;
        u8 index;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\field{features} are the 32 bits of features currently accessed, while
\field{index} describes which of the feature bit values is to be
accessed. No padding is added at the end of the structure, it is
exactly 5 bytes in length.

The guest obtains the device's device feature set via the
CCW_CMD_READ_FEAT command. The device stores the features at \field{index}
to \field{features}.

For communicating its supported features to the device, the driver
uses the CCW_CMD_WRITE_FEAT command, denoting a \field{features}/\field{index}
combination.

\subsubsection{Device Configuration}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Device Configuration}

The device's configuration space is located in host memory.

To obtain information from the configuration space, the driver
uses CCW_CMD_READ_CONF, specifying the guest memory for the device
to write to.

For changing configuration information, the driver uses
CCW_CMD_WRITE_CONF, specifying the guest memory for the device to
read from.

In both cases, the complete configuration space is transmitted.  This
allows the driver to compare the new configuration space with the old
version, and keep a generation count internally whenever it changes.

\subsubsection{Setting Up Indicators}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators}

In order to set up the indicator bits for host->guest notification,
the driver uses different channel commands depending on whether it
wishes to use traditional I/O interrupts tied to a subchannel or
adapter I/O interrupts for virtqueue notifications. For any given
device, the two mechanisms are mutually exclusive.

For the configuration change indicators, only a mechanism using
traditional I/O interrupts is provided, regardless of whether
traditional or adapter I/O interrupts are used for virtqueue
notifications.

\paragraph{Setting Up Classic Queue Indicators}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators / Setting Up Classic Queue Indicators}

Indicators for notification via classic I/O interrupts are contained
in a 64 bit value per virtio-ccw proxy device.

To communicate the location of the indicator bits for host->guest
notification, the driver uses the CCW_CMD_SET_IND command,
pointing to a location containing the guest address of the
indicators in a 64 bit value.

If the driver has already set up two-staged queue indicators via the
CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER command, the device MUST post a unit check
with command reject to any subsequent CCW_CMD_SET_IND command.

\paragraph{Setting Up Configuration Change Indicators}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators / Setting Up Configuration Change Indicators}

Indicators for configuration change host->guest notification are
contained in a 64 bit value per virtio-ccw proxy device.

To communicate the location of the indicator bits used in the
configuration change host->guest notification, the driver issues the
CCW_CMD_SET_CONF_IND command, pointing to a location containing the
guest address of the indicators in a 64 bit value.

\paragraph{Setting Up Two-Stage Queue Indicators}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators / Setting Up Two-Stage Queue Indicators}

Indicators for notification via adapter I/O interrupts consist of
two stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item a summary indicator byte covering the virtqueues for one or more
  virtio-ccw proxy devices
\item a set of contigous indicator bits for the virtqueues for a
  virtio-ccw proxy device
\end{itemize}

To communicate the location of the summary and queue indicator bits,
the driver uses the CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER command with the following
payload:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_thinint_area {
        be64 summary_indicator;
        be64 indicator;
        be64 bit_nr;
        u8 isc;
} __attribute__ ((packed));
\end{lstlisting}

\field{summary_indicator} contains the guest address of the 8 bit summary
indicator.
\field{indicator} contains the guest address of an area wherein the indicators
for the devices are contained, starting at \field{bit_nr}, one bit per
virtqueue of the device. Bit numbers start at the left, i.e. the most
significant bit in the first byte is assigned the bit number 0.
\field{isc} contains the I/O interruption subclass to be used for the adapter
I/O interrupt. It MAY be different from the isc used by the proxy
virtio-ccw device's subchannel.
No padding is added at the end of the structure, it is exactly 25 bytes
in length.


\devicenormative{\subparagraph}{Setting Up Two-Stage Queue Indicators}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators / Setting Up Two-Stage Queue Indicators}
If the driver has already set up classic queue indicators via the
CCW_CMD_SET_IND command, the device MUST post a unit check with
command reject to any subsequent CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER command.

\paragraph{Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Setting Up Indicators}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Initialization / Setting Up Indicators / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Setting Up Indicators}

In some cases, legacy devices will only support classic queue indicators;
in that case, they will reject CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER as they don't know that
command. Some legacy devices will support two-stage queue indicators, though,
and a driver will be able to successfully use CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER to set
them up.

\subsection{Device Operation}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation}

\subsubsection{Host->Guest Notification}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification}

There are two modes of operation regarding host->guest notification,
classic I/O interrupts and adapter I/O interrupts. The mode to be
used is determined by the driver by using CCW_CMD_SET_IND respectively
CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER to set up queue indicators.

For configuration changes, the driver always uses classic I/O
interrupts.

\paragraph{Notification via Classic I/O Interrupts}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Classic I/O Interrupts}

If the driver used the CCW_CMD_SET_IND command to set up queue
indicators, the device will use classic I/O interrupts for
host->guest notification about virtqueue activity.

For notifying the driver of virtqueue buffers, the device sets the
corresponding bit in the guest-provided indicators. If an
interrupt is not already pending for the subchannel, the device
generates an unsolicited I/O interrupt.

If the device wants to notify the driver about configuration
changes, it sets bit 0 in the configuration indicators and
generates an unsolicited I/O interrupt, if needed. This also
applies if adapter I/O interrupts are used for queue notifications.

\paragraph{Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}

If the driver used the CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER command to set up
queue indicators, the device will use adapter I/O interrupts for
host->guest notification about virtqueue activity.

For notifying the driver of virtqueue buffers, the device sets the
bit in the guest-provided indicator area at the corresponding offset.
The guest-provided summary indicator is set to 0x01. An adapter I/O
interrupt for the corresponding interruption subclass is generated.

The recommended way to process an adapter I/O interrupt by the driver
is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Process all queue indicator bits associated with the summary indicator.
\item Clear the summary indicator, performing a synchronization (memory
barrier) afterwards.
\item Process all queue indicator bits associated with the summary indicator
again.
\end{itemize}

\devicenormative{\subparagraph}{Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}

The device SHOULD only generate an adapter I/O interrupt if the
summary indicator had not been set prior to notification.

\drivernormative{\subparagraph}{Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Notification via Adapter I/O Interrupts}
The driver
MUST clear the summary indicator after receiving an adapter I/O
interrupt before it processes the queue indicators.

\paragraph{Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Host->Guest Notification}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Host->Guest Notification / Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Host->Guest Notification}

As legacy devices and drivers support only classic queue indicators,
host->guest notification will always be done via classic I/O interrupts.

\subsubsection{Guest->Host Notification}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Guest->Host Notification}

For notifying the device of virtqueue buffers, the driver
unfortunately can't use a channel command (the asynchronous
characteristics of channel I/O interact badly with the host block
I/O backend). Instead, it uses a diagnose 0x500 call with subcode
3 specifying the queue, as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
\hline
GPR  &   Input Value     & Output Value \\
\hline \hline
  1   &       0x3         &              \\
\hline
  2   &  Subchannel ID    & Host Cookie  \\
\hline
  3   & Notification data &              \\
\hline
  4   &   Host Cookie     &              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has not been negotiated,
the \field{Notification data} contains the Virtqueue number.

When VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA has been negotiated,
the value has the following format:
\lstinputlisting{notifications-be.c}

See \ref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}~\nameref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}
for the definition of the components.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Guest->Host Notification}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Guest->Host Notification}
The device MUST ignore bits 0-31 (counting from the left) of GPR2.
This aligns passing the subchannel ID with the way it is passed
for the existing I/O instructions.

The device MAY return a 64-bit host cookie in GPR2 to speed up the
notification execution.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Guest->Host Notification}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Guest->Host Notification}

For each notification, the driver SHOULD use GPR4 to pass the host cookie received in GPR2 from the previous notication.

\begin{note}
For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
info->cookie = do_notify(schid,
                         virtqueue_get_queue_index(vq),
                         info->cookie);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Resetting Devices}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Resetting Devices}

In order to reset a device, a driver sends the
CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET command. This command does not carry any payload.

The device signals completion of the virtio reset operation through successful
conclusion of the CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET channel command. In particular, the
command not only triggers the reset operation, but the reset operation is
already completed when the operation concludes successfully.

\devicenormative{\paragraph}{Resetting Devices}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Resetting Devices}

The device MUST finish the virtio reset operation and reinitialize
\field{device status} to zero before it concludes the CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET
command successfully.

The device MUST NOT send notifications or interact with the queues after
it signaled successful conclusion of the CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET command.

\drivernormative{\paragraph}{Resetting Devices}{Virtio Transport Options / Virtio over channel I/O / Device Operation / Resetting Devices}

The driver MAY consider the virtio reset operation to be complete already after
successful conclusion of the CCW_CMD_VDEV_RESET channel command, although it
MAY also choose to verify reset completion by reading \field{device status} via
CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS and checking whether it is 0 afterwards.

\chapter{Device Types}\label{sec:Device Types}

On top of the queues, config space and feature negotiation facilities
built into virtio, several devices are defined.

The following device IDs are used to identify different types of virtio
devices.  Some device IDs are reserved for devices which are not currently
defined in this standard.

Discovering what devices are available and their type is bus-dependent.

Some of the devices above are unspecified by this document,

them no further.

\chapter{Reserved Feature Bits}\label{sec:Reserved Feature Bits}

Currently these device-independent feature bits are defined:

\begin{description}
  \item[VIRTIO_F_INDIRECT_DESC (28)] Negotiating this feature indicates
  that the driver can use descriptors with the VIRTQ_DESC_F_INDIRECT
  flag set, as described in \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio
Device / Virtqueues / The Virtqueue Descriptor Table / Indirect
Descriptors}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device /
Virtqueues / The Virtqueue Descriptor Table / Indirect
Descriptors} and \ref{sec:Packed Virtqueues / Indirect Flag: Scatter-Gather Support}~\nameref{sec:Packed Virtqueues / Indirect Flag: Scatter-Gather Support}.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_EVENT_IDX(29)] This feature enables the \field{used_event}
  and the \field{avail_event} fields as described in
\ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Used Buffer Notification Suppression}, \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / The Virtqueue Used Ring} and \ref{sec:Packed Virtqueues / Driver and Device Event Suppression}.


  \item[VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1(32)] This indicates compliance with this
    specification, giving a simple way to detect legacy devices or drivers.

  \item[VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM(33)] This feature indicates that
  the device can be used on a platform where device access to data
  in memory is limited and/or translated. E.g. this is the case if the device can be located
  behind an IOMMU that translates bus addresses from the device into physical
  addresses in memory, if the device can be limited to only access
  certain memory addresses or if special commands such as
  a cache flush can be needed to synchronise data in memory with
  the device. Whether accesses are actually limited or translated
  is described by platform-specific means.
  If this feature bit is set to 0, then the device
  has same access to memory addresses supplied to it as the
  driver has.
  In particular, the device will always use physical addresses
  matching addresses used by the driver (typically meaning
  physical addresses used by the CPU)
  and not translated further, and can access any address supplied to it by
  the driver. When clear, this overrides any platform-specific description of
  whether device access is limited or translated in any way, e.g.
  whether an IOMMU may be present.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED(34)] This feature indicates
  support for the packed virtqueue layout as described in
  \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Packed Virtqueues}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Packed Virtqueues}.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER(35)] This feature indicates
  that all buffers are used by the device in the same
  order in which they have been made available.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM(36)] This feature indicates
  that memory accesses by the driver and the device are ordered
  in a way described by the platform.

  If this feature bit is negotiated, the ordering in effect for any
  memory accesses by the driver that need to be ordered in a specific way
  with respect to accesses by the device is the one suitable for devices
  described by the platform. This implies that the driver needs to use
  memory barriers suitable for devices described by the platform; e.g.
  for the PCI transport in the case of hardware PCI devices.

  If this feature bit is not negotiated, then the device
  and driver are assumed to be implemented in software, that is
  they can be assumed to run on identical CPUs
  in an SMP configuration.
  Thus a weaker form of memory barriers is sufficient
  to yield better performance.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV(37)] This feature indicates that
  the device supports Single Root I/O Virtualization.
  Currently only PCI devices support this feature.
  \item[VIRTIO_F_NOTIFICATION_DATA(38)] This feature indicates
  that the driver passes extra data (besides identifying the virtqueue)
  in its device notifications.
  See \ref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}~\nameref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}.

  \item[VIRTIO_F_NOTIF_CONFIG_DATA(39)] This feature indicates that the driver
  uses the data provided by the device as a virtqueue identifier in available
  buffer notifications.
  As mentioned in section \ref{sec:Virtqueues / Driver notifications}, when the
  driver is required to send an available buffer notification to the device, it
  sends the virtqueue number to be notified. The method of delivering
  notifications is transport specific.
  With the PCI transport, the device can optionally provide a per-virtqueue value
  for the driver to use in driver notifications, instead of the virtqueue number.
  Some devices may benefit from this flexibility by providing, for example,
  an internal virtqueue identifier, or an internal offset related to the
  virtqueue number.

  This feature indicates the availability of such value. The definition of the
  data to be provided in driver notification and the delivery method is
  transport specific.
  For more details about driver notifications over PCI see \ref{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over PCI Bus / PCI-specific Initialization And Device Operation / Available Buffer Notifications}.

  \item[VIRTIO_F_RING_RESET(40)] This feature indicates
  that the driver can reset a queue individually.
  See \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Virtqueue Reset}.

\end{description}

A driver SHOULD accept VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM if it is offered.
If VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM has been negotiated, a driver MUST use
the barriers suitable for hardware devices.

If VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV has been negotiated, a driver MAY enable
virtual functions through the device's PCI SR-IOV capability
structure.  A driver MUST NOT negotiate VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV if
the device does not have a PCI SR-IOV capability structure
or is not a PCI device.  A driver MUST negotiate
VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV and complete the feature negotiation
(including checking the FEATURES_OK \field{device status}
bit) before enabling virtual functions through the device's
PCI SR-IOV capability structure.  After once successfully
negotiating VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV, the driver MAY enable virtual
functions through the device's PCI SR-IOV capability
structure even if the device or the system has been fully
or partially reset, and even without re-negotiating
VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV after the reset.

A driver SHOULD accept VIRTIO_F_NOTIF_CONFIG_DATA if it is offered.

\devicenormative{\section}{Reserved Feature Bits}{Reserved Feature Bits}

A device MUST offer VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1.  A device MAY fail to operate further
if VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 is not accepted.

A device SHOULD offer VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM if its access to
memory is through bus addresses distinct from and translated
by the platform to physical addresses used by the driver, and/or
if it can only access certain memory addresses with said access
specified and/or granted by the platform.
A device MAY fail to operate further if VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not
accepted.

If VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER has been negotiated, a device MUST use
buffers in the same order in which they have been available.

A device MAY fail to operate further if
VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM is offered but not accepted.
A device MAY operate in a slower emulation mode if
VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM is offered but not accepted.

It is RECOMMENDED that an add-in card based PCI device
offers both VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM and
VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM for maximum portability.

A device SHOULD offer VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV if it is a PCI device
and presents a PCI SR-IOV capability structure, otherwise
it MUST NOT offer VIRTIO_F_SR_IOV.

\section{Legacy Interface: Reserved Feature Bits}\label{sec:Reserved Feature Bits / Legacy Interface: Reserved Feature Bits}

Transitional devices MAY offer the following:
\begin{description}
\item[VIRTIO_F_NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY (24)] If this feature
  has been negotiated by driver, the device MUST issue
  a used buffer notification if the device runs
  out of available descriptors on a virtqueue, even though
  notifications are suppressed using the VIRTQ_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT
  flag or the \field{used_event} field.
\begin{note}
  An example of a driver using this feature is the legacy
  networking driver: it doesn't need to know every time a packet
  is transmitted, but it does need to free the transmitted
  packets a finite time after they are transmitted. It can avoid
  using a timer if the device notifies it when all the packets
  are transmitted.
\end{note}
\end{description}

Transitional devices MUST offer, and if offered by the device
transitional drivers MUST accept the following:
\begin{description}
\item[VIRTIO_F_ANY_LAYOUT (27)] This feature indicates that the device
  accepts arbitrary descriptor layouts, as described in Section
  \ref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Message Framing / Legacy Interface: Message Framing}~\nameref{sec:Basic Facilities of a Virtio Device / Virtqueues / Message Framing / Legacy Interface: Message Framing}.

\item[UNUSED (30)] Bit 30 is used by qemu's implementation to check
  for experimental early versions of virtio which did not perform
  correct feature negotiation, and SHOULD NOT be negotiated.
\end{description}
