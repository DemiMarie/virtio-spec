\section{RPMB Device}\label{sec:Device Types / RPMB Device}

virtio-rpmb is a virtio based RPMB (Replay Protected Memory Block)
device. It is used as a tamper-resistant and anti-replay storage.
The device is driven via requests including read, write, get write
counter and program key, which are submitted via a request queue.
This section relies on definitions from paragraph 6.6.22 of
\hyperref[intro:eMMC]{eMMC}.

\subsection{Feature bits}\label{sec:Device Types / RPMB Device / Feature bits}

None.

\subsection{Device configuration layout}\label{sec:Device Types / RPMB Device / Device configuration layout}

All fields of this configuration are always available and read-only for the driver.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_rpmb_config {
        u8 capacity;
        u8 max_wr_cnt;
        u8 max_rd_cnt;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
\item[\field{capacity}] is the capacity of the device (expressed in 128KB units).
   The values MUST range between 0x00 and 0x80 inclusive.
\item[\field{max_wr_cnt and max_rd_cnt}] are the maximum numbers of RPMB
   block count (256B) that can be performed to device in one request. 0 implies
   no limitation.
\end{description}

\devicenormative{\subsection}{Device Initialization}{Device Types / RPMB Device / Device Initialization}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The virtqueue is initialized.
\item The device capacity MUST be initialized to a multiple of 128Kbytes and up to
   16Mbytes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Device Operation}\label{sec:Device Types / RPMB Device / Device Operation}

The operation of a virtio RPMB device is driven by the requests placed on the virtqueue.
  The type of request can be program key (VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_PROGRAM_KEY),
  get write counter (VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_GET_WRITE_COUNTER),
  write (VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_DATA_WRITE), and read (VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_DATA_READ).
  A program key or write request can also combine with a
  result read (VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_RESULT_READ) for a returned result.

\begin{lstlisting}
/* RPMB Request Types */
#define VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_PROGRAM_KEY        0x0001

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
\item[\field{VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_PROGRAM_KEY}] requests for authentication key programming.
  If VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_RESULT_READ is requested, the device returns the RPMB frame with
  the response (VIRTIO_RPMB_RESP_PROGRAM_KEY), the calculated MAC and the result.

\item[\field{VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_GET_WRITE_COUNTER}] requests for reading the write counter.
   The device returns the RPMB frame with the response (VIRTIO_RPMB_RESP_GET_COUNTER),
   the writer counter, a copy of the nonce received in the request, the calculated
   MAC and the result.

\item[\field{VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_DATA_WRITE}] requests for authenticated data write.
   If VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_RESULT_READ is requested, the device returns the RPMB data
   frame with the response (VIRTIO_RPMB_RESP_DATA_WRITE), the incremented counter value,
   the data address, the calculated MAC and the result.

\item[\field{VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_DATA_READ}] requests for authenticated data read.
   The device returns the RPMB frame with the response (VIRTIO_RPMB_RESP_DATA_READ),
   the block count, a copy of the nonce received in the request, the address,
   the data, the calculated MAC and the result.

\item[\field{VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_RESULT_READ}] requests for a returned result.
   It is used following with VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_PROGRAM_KEY or VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_DATA_WRITE
   request types for a returned result in one or multiple RPMB frames. If it's not
   requested, the device will not return result frame to the driver.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Device Operation: Request Queue}\label{sec:Device Types / RPMB Device / Device Operation / Device Operation: Request Queue}

The request information is delivered in RPMB frame.
The frame is in size of 512B.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct virtio_rpmb_frame {
        u8 stuff[196];
        u8 key_mac[32];
        u8 data[256];
        u8 nonce[16];
        be32 write_counter;
        be16 address;
        be16 block_count;
        be16 result;
        be16 req_resp;
};

/* RPMB Operation Results */
#define VIRTIO_RPMB_RES_OK                     0x0000
#define VIRTIO_RPMB_RES_GENERAL_FAILURE        0x0001

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
\item[\field{stuff}] Padding for the frame.

\item[\field{key_mac}] is the authentication key or the message
   authentication code (MAC) depending on the request/response type.
   If the request is VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_PROGRAM_KEY, it's used as an
   authentication key. Otherwise, it's used as MAC. The MAC is calculated
   using HMAC SHA-256. It takes as input a key and a message. The key
   used for the MAC calculation is always the 256-bit RPMB authentication
   key. The message used as input to the MAC calculation is the
   concatenation of the fields in the RPMB frames excluding stuff bytes
   and the MAC itself.

\item[\field{data}] is used to be written or read via authenticated
   read/write access. It's fixed 256B.

\item[\field{nonce}] is a random number generated by the user for the read
   or get write counter requests and copied to the response by the device.
   It's used for anti-replay protection.

\item[\field{writer_counter}] is the counter value for the total amount of
   the successful authenticated data write requests.

\item[\field{address}] is the address of the data to be written to or read
   from the RPMB virtio device. It is the number of the accessed
   half sector (256B).

\item[\field{block_count}] is the number of blocks (256B) requested to be
   read/written. It's limited by \field{max_wr_cnt} or \field{max_rd_cnt}.
   For RPMB read request, one virtio buffer including request command and
   the subsequent [\field{block_count}] virtio buffers for response data
   are placed in the queue.
   For RPMB write request, [\field{block_count}] virtio buffers including
   request command and data are placed in the queue.

\item[\field{result}] includes information about the status of access made
   to the device. It is written by the device.

\item[\field{req_resp}] is the type of request or response, to/from the device.

If VIRTIO_RPMB_REQ_RESULT_READ is requested, the device SHOULD return the
RPMB frame with the response, the calculated MAC and the result:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the \field{block_count} is not set to 1 then
   VIRTIO_RPMB_RES_GENERAL_FAILURE SHOULD be responded as \field{result}.

\item If the programming of authentication key fails,
   then VIRTIO_RPMB_RES_WRITE_FAILURE SHOULD be responded as \field{result}.

\drivernormative{\subsubsection}{Device Operation}{Device Types / RPMB Device / Device Operation}

The RPMB frames MUST not be packed by the driver.
The driver MUST configure, initialize and format virtqueue for the RPMB requests received from its caller then send it to the device.

\devicenormative{\subsubsection}{Device Operation}{Device Types / RPMB Device / Device Operation}

The virtio-rpmb device could be backed in a number of ways. It SHOULD
   keep consistent behaviors with hardware as described in paragraph
   6.6.22 of \hyperref[intro:eMMC]{eMMC}.
   Some elements are maintained by the device:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The device MUST maintain a one-time programmable authentication key.
   It cannot be overwritten, erased or read. The key is used to
   authenticate the accesses when MAC is calculated. This key MUST be
   kept regardless of device reset or reboot.
\item The device MUST maintain a read-only monotonic write counter. It
  MUST be initialized to zero and added by one automatically along with
   successful write operation. The value cannot be reset. After
   the counter has reached its maximum value 0xFFFF FFFF, it will
   not be incremented anymore. This counter MUST be kept regardless
   of device reset or reboot.
\item The device MUST maintain the data for read/write via authenticated
   access.
\end{enumerate}
